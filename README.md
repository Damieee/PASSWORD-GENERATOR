Project: Math Problem Generator

In this project, you'll write a Python program that generates math problems and asks the user to solve them. The program will keep track of the user's score and give them a final score at the end.

Instructions:

Clone the project repository to your local machine.
Open the math_problem_generator.py file in your favorite text editor or IDE.
Read through the code and try to understand what it does.

Modify the code to add a feature that lets the user choose 

Test your code to make sure it works as expected.
Submit your modified code as a pull request to the project repository.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Git

Navigate to the project directory:

$ cd math-problem-generator
Run the math_problem_generator.py file:

$ python math_problem_generator.py

Follow the prompts to generate and solve math problems.

Example

Welcome to the Math Problem Generator!
What type of problem would you like to generate? (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division): addition

How many problems would you like to generate? 5
22 + 56 = 78
Correct!
44 + 3 = 47
Correct!
28 + 75 = 103
Correct!
48 + 1 = 50
Correct!
96 + 60 = 156
Correct!
You got 5/5 problems correct. Your score is 100.0%


Your Task..
write the code that shouldbe in the main function.
You already have the  generate_problems function that generates the logics written for you. Your task is to write the function to ensure it meets the requirement. 

hints:
1. Use a for loop too iterate through the appended problems in problems list. 
2. create a score variable that increments user score everytime they got a question right.
